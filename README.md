# Codelists DynAIRx
## Introduction
These **codelists** are part of DynAIRx Project. DynAIRx has been funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Artificial Intelligence for Multiple Long-Term Conditions (AIM). 
<br>
<br>
**Collaboration** This NIHR Funded project is collaboration of University of Manchester, University of Leeds, University of Liverpool, Merseycare NHS, Wales Powys Teaching Health Board, and University of Glasgow, UK.
<br>
<br>
**About DynAIRx** DynAIRx (Artificial Intelligence for dynamic prescribing optimisation and care integration in multimorbidity) aims to develop new, easy to use, artificial intelligence (AI) tools that support General Practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists to find patients living with multimorbidity (two or more long-term health conditions) who might be offered a better combination of medicines.

## Codelists
This repository contains codelists (consisting of SNOMEDs) of ~260 coditions. Mappings from SNOMEOs to ReadCode, MedCode or any other codes are avaliable in [DynAIRx framework](https://github.com/DynAIRx/GCAF_DynAIRx). These lists are compiled mainly with baseline codelists eFI, Caliber, and few other project specific codelists. Please find more details in [paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.25.24314215v1).


## GCAF_DynAIRx
These codelists are generated using Generalised Codelist Automation Framework (GCAF). This is generalized framework developed by Computer Scientists  to generate codelists for any medical project with modifications in input. Please use this [link](https://github.com/DynAIRx/GCAF_DynAIRx) to use this framework in your project.
